# Exploratory Data Analysis Workshop

This workshop is part of the [The Missing Link in Publishing: Interactive Data Visualisation](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/event/missing-link-publishing-interactive-data-visualisation) event held by University of Oxford on 4th December 2017.

The workshop is designed to introduce participants to how `R` can be used for exploratory data analysis and visualisation.

# What do I need on my computer?

To participate in this workshop, please sure you have the following:

- An installation of R [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- An installation of RStudio [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# How much will I learn?

As much as we can comfortably achieve in 1h 30! If you've never used R before you'll be given the following complete (and reproducible) workflow:

- Organise files ready for R
- Import .csv files into R
- Wrangle messy data into well formatted data
- Summarise and calculate exploratory statistical summaries of your data
- Visualise your data with a variery of charts and maps

We recommend these additional resources for learning more about R

- Datacamp.com [free introduction to R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r): an excellent introduction to the basics of the language, but *skip the matrices chapter*

- [R for Data Science](r4ds.had.co.nz): an excellent free to read online book that introduces how to use the `tidyverse` for a consistent approach to doing data science with R.

- [Learning the R Tidyverse Lynda.com Course](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Learning-R-Tidyverse/586672-2.html): an overview of the tidyverse designed for new R users (University of Oxford reseachers [use the link](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Learning-R-Tidyverse/586672-2.html?org=ox.ac.uk))

- OxShef: This is a collaboration between the [IDN](idn.it.ox.ac.uk) at University of Oxford and [ORDA](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/orda) at University of Sheffield which provides [advice on choosing interactive visualisations](oxshef.github.io/oshef_charts) for communicating research data and [where to publish interactive data visualisations](https://oxshef.github.io/oxshef/).
